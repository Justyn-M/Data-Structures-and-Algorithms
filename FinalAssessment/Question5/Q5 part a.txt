Question 5 part a

After familiarising myself with the data in 6degrees.csv, I have examined that the data is sorted into columns Movie,Year,,Actor,,Role.
To represent the connections between the columns as a graph to answer particularly part c of question 5, I will be making the desired
actor and the movies that he/she is in graph vertexs for displayActorsMovies(name). For displayMovieActors(name), I will be making the
desired movie and its actors graph vertexs. To accomplish isolating the actors and movies into vertexes easily in python, I will be using 
the pandas library. The following diagrams visualise the vertexes and its edges depending on the function:

displayActorsMovies(name)

actor -> Movie
  |
  v
Movie

The arrows represent the edges that the actor vertex has. The actor has edges to movies but movies dont have edges to the actor or other
movies. When the program is executed, only the actor vertex and all its edges to movies will be printed. 
Actor (actor vertex) | Movie (edges)

displayMovieActors(name)

Movie -> actor
  |
  V
actor

The arrows represent the edges that a movie vertex has. The movie has edges to actors but actos do not have edges to the movie or other
actors. When the program is executed, only the movie vertex and all its edges to actors will be printed.
Movie (movie vertex) | Actor (edges)
